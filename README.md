Instructions
=========

Make a list of your favorite Metacritic publications by clicking the MyMeta icon on the toolbar and clicking the "+" button at the bottom. Make sure that the publications are written exactly as they appear on Metacritic.  Click "Remove" to remove one from your list. Your custom Metacritic score will appear next to the normal Metascore when you view the page of any reviewed item on the site.
